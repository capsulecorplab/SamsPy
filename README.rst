README for SamsPy
=================

*SamsPy* is a collection of simple aerospace models in Python.
(Anyway, that's the plan.)

It has been developed on Linux (Ubuntu 12.04) and Mac OS X (Mavericks)
using Python 3 and the corresponding YAML and Nose packages.

More details are given in the file ``docs/overview.rst``.
An initial example is given in ``docs/examples/lvbasic.rst``.
